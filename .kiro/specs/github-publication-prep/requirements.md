# Requirements Document

## Introduction

文化の森お出かけパス施設休館情報エージェントプロジェクトをGitHubに公開するための準備作業を行います。プロジェクトには多数のテストファイル、デバッグファイル、一時的なファイルが含まれており、これらを整理してセキュリティ対策を施し、適切なドキュメントを整備する必要があります。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to clean up unnecessary files, so that the repository is organized and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the project structure THEN the system SHALL identify all temporary, debug, and test files that are not essential for the core functionality
2. WHEN cleaning up files THEN the system SHALL remove all files with naming patterns like `test_*`, `debug_*`, `check_*`, `analyze_*`, `fix_*`, `investigate_*`, `search_*`, `verify_*`, `find_*`, `quick_*`, `simple_*`, `final_*`, `improved_*`, `enhanced_*`, `advanced_*`, `ultimate_*`
3. WHEN cleaning up files THEN the system SHALL remove all JSON result files, PNG screenshot files, PDF files, and TXT log files
4. WHEN cleaning up files THEN the system SHALL preserve only the core application files: `agent.py`, `facility_scraper.py`, `config.py`, `deploy.py`, `setup.py`

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want to ensure no sensitive information is exposed, so that the repository is safe to publish publicly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning for sensitive data THEN the system SHALL verify that no API keys, passwords, or AWS credentials are hardcoded in any files
2. WHEN reviewing configuration THEN the system SHALL ensure all sensitive configuration uses environment variables or external configuration files
3. WHEN preparing for publication THEN the system SHALL create appropriate `.gitignore` entries to prevent accidental inclusion of sensitive files
4. WHEN reviewing code THEN the system SHALL ensure no personal information, internal URLs, or proprietary data is exposed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a potential user or contributor, I want comprehensive documentation, so that I can understand and use the project effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating documentation THEN the system SHALL update the README.md with clear project description, setup instructions, and usage examples
2. WHEN documenting the project THEN the system SHALL include installation requirements, dependencies, and system requirements
3. WHEN providing usage guidance THEN the system SHALL include example commands and expected outputs
4. WHEN documenting for contributors THEN the system SHALL include contribution guidelines and development setup instructions
5. WHEN creating documentation THEN the system SHALL ensure all documentation is in Japanese to match the project's target audience

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper project structure and configuration files, so that the project follows best practices and is easy to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL create a comprehensive `.gitignore` file appropriate for Python projects
2. WHEN configuring the project THEN the system SHALL ensure `requirements.txt` contains only necessary dependencies
3. WHEN organizing the project THEN the system SHALL create appropriate directory structure for source code, documentation, and configuration
4. WHEN preparing for publication THEN the system SHALL add a LICENSE file with appropriate open source license
5. WHEN setting up CI/CD THEN the system SHALL consider adding GitHub Actions workflow files for automated testing and deployment

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to optimize the repository size and performance, so that it loads quickly and doesn't waste storage space.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleaning up the repository THEN the system SHALL remove all large binary files that are not essential
2. WHEN optimizing the repository THEN the system SHALL ensure the total repository size is reasonable for GitHub hosting
3. WHEN reviewing file structure THEN the system SHALL consolidate or remove duplicate functionality across multiple files
4. WHEN preparing for publication THEN the system SHALL ensure all remaining files serve a clear purpose in the final application
