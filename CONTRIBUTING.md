- **Python Style**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- **Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive variable and function names
- **Comments**: Write clear, concise comments for complex logic
- **Error Handling**: Include appropriate error handling and logging

### Facility Scraper Development

When adding support for new facilities or updating existing scrapers:

1. **Study the facility's website structure**
2. **Implement robust scraping logic** that handles:
   - Different page layouts
   - Temporary changes in website structure
   - Network timeouts and errors
3. **Test thoroughly** with various dates and scenarios
4. **Document the scraping approach** in code comments

### Testing

- **Manual Testing**: Test with real facility websites
- **Edge Cases**: Consider holidays, maintenance periods, etc.
- **Error Scenarios**: Test network failures, parsing errors
- **Date Handling**: Test with various date formats and edge cases

## üåê Internationalization

### Language Support

- **Primary Language**: English (for international accessibility)
- **Secondary Language**: Japanese (for local users)
- **Documentation**: Maintain both English and Japanese versions

### Adding Translations

1. **Create `.ja.md` versions** of documentation files
2. **Keep content synchronized** between language versions
3. **Use appropriate cultural context** for each language
4. **Test with native speakers** when possible

## üîí Security Considerations

### Responsible Disclosure

If you discover security vulnerabilities:

1. **Do not create public issues** for security problems
2. **Contact maintainers privately** first
3. **Provide detailed information** about the vulnerability
4. **Allow time for fixes** before public disclosure

### Scraping Ethics

- **Respect robots.txt** files
- **Implement reasonable delays** between requests
